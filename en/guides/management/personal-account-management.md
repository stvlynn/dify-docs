# Personal Account Management

## Login Methods

The login methods supported by different versions of Dify are as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th width="166">Version</th><th>Login Method</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Community</td><td>Email and password</td></tr><tr><td>Cloud</td><td>GitHub account authorization, Google account authorization, email and verification code</td></tr></tbody></table>

> Note: For Dify Cloud Service, if the email associated with a GitHub or Google account is the same as the email used to log in with a verification code, the system will automatically link them as the same account, avoiding the need for manual binding and preventing duplicate registrations.
